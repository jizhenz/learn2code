    "This section used to document the rules for coercion. As the language has evolved, the coercion rules have become hard to document precisely; documenting what one version of one particular implementation does is undesirable. Instead, here are some informal guidelines regarding coercion. In Python 3, coercion will not be supported.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If the left operand of a % operator is a string or Unicode object, no coercion takes place and the string formatting operation is invoked instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "    It is no longer recommended to define a coercion operation. Mixed-mode operations on types that don’t define coercion pass the original arguments to the operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "    New-style classes (those derived from object) never invoke the __coerce__() method in response to a binary operator; the only time __coerce__() is invoked is when the built-in function coerce() is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For most intents and purposes, an operator that returns NotImplemented is treated the same as one that is not implemented at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Below, __op__() and __rop__() are used to signify the generic method names corresponding to an operator; __iop__() is used for the corresponding in-place operator. For example, for the operator ‘+‘, __add__() and __radd__() are used for the left and right variant of the binary operator, and __iadd__() for the in-place variant.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For objects x and y, first x.__op__(y) is tried. If this is not implemented or returns NotImplemented, y.__rop__(x) is tried. If this is also not implemented or returns NotImplemented, a TypeError exception is raised. But see the following exception:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Exception to the previous item: if the left operand is an instance of a built-in type or a new-style class, and the right operand is an instance of a proper subclass of that type or class and overrides the base’s __rop__() method, the right operand’s __rop__() method is tried before the left operand’s __op__() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This is done so that a subclass can completely override binary operators. Otherwise, the left operand’s __op__() method would always accept the right operand: when an instance of a given class is expected, an instance of a subclass of that class is always acceptable.\n",
    "\n",
    "    When either operand type defines a coercion, this coercion is called before that type’s __op__() or __rop__() method is called, but no sooner. If the coercion returns an object of a different type for the operand whose coercion is invoked, part of the process is redone using the new object.\n",
    "\n",
    "    When an in-place operator (like ‘+=‘) is used, if the left operand implements __iop__(), it is invoked without any coercion. When the operation falls back to __op__() and/or __rop__(), the normal coercion rules apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In x + y, if x is a sequence that implements sequence concatenation, sequence concatenation is invoked.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In x * y, if one operand is a sequence that implements sequence repetition, and the other is an integer (int or long), sequence repetition is invoked.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Rich comparisons (implemented by methods __eq__() and so on) never use coercion. Three-way comparison (implemented by __cmp__()) does use coercion under the same conditions as other binary operations use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In the current implementation, the built-in numeric types int, long, float, and complex do not use coercion. All these types implement a __coerce__() method, for use by the built-in coerce() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Changed in version 2.7: The complex type no longer makes implicit calls to the __coerce__() method for mixed-type binary arithmetic operations.\n",
